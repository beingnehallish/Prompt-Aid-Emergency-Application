# Prompt Aid

## Overview
Prompt Aid is a mobile application designed to provide fast and easy access to emergency services in critical situations. It allows users to quickly contact authorities such as the police, ambulance, traffic police, woman helplines, and more, with just a tap.

The app automatically dials the relevant emergency number and sends an SMS with the user's current location, ensuring help arrives quickly. It also includes a profile page where users can store important personal and medical information like their name, address, blood group, and any important medical history emergency contacts.

Additionally, a voice-assisted AidBot provides instant first aid and emergency information through both speech and text. The app uses real-time location tracking to ensure accurate help and stores all necessary data locally for easy access even when offline.
